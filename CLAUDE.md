# CLAUDE.md - crosslink-viewer

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the crosslink-viewer submodule within the build-xiview project.

## Component Overview

The crosslink-viewer submodule contains xiNET, a web-based visualization tool for cross-linking mass spectrometry data. It provides interactive network visualization of protein cross-links with residue-level resolution.

## Role in build-xiview Project

crosslink-viewer serves as the **network visualization component** within the xiVIEW ecosystem:

- **Network Display**: Interactive visualization of protein cross-link networks
- **Residue Resolution**: Detailed view of cross-link positions on protein sequences
- **Layout Algorithms**: Sophisticated network layout and clustering capabilities

## Architecture

### Key Directories

- **`src/`**: Core xiNET source code and modules
- **`css/`**: Stylesheets for network visualization
- **`vendor/`**: Third-party libraries and dependencies
- **`js/`**: JavaScript modules and utilities
- **`images/`**: Icons and graphics for the interface

### Technology Stack

- **D3.js**: Data visualization and network layout
- **JavaScript**: Modern ES6+ features for component logic
- **SVG**: Vector graphics for scalable network rendering
- **CSS**: Styling for interactive network elements

## Development Workflow

### Branch Information
- **Current branch**: `master`
- **Development branch**: `master`

### File Organization

- **Core Components**: Place main visualization logic in `src/`
- **Styling**: Network-specific CSS in `css/` directory
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and modules in `js/`
- **Assets**: Icons and images in `images/` directory

### Code Conventions

- **Modular Design**: Separate network layout, rendering, and interaction concerns
- **D3 Patterns**: Follow D3.js best practices for data-driven visualizations
- **Event Handling**: Clean event delegation and interaction patterns
- **Performance**: Optimize for large network datasets

## Development Guidelines

### Integration Points

- **Data Import**: Accepts cross-link data from CLMS-model structures
- **Filtering**: Responds to data filtering and selection from parent application

## Integration with build-xiview

### Component Integration

crosslink-viewer operates as a visualization component that:
- Receives cross-link data through defined interfaces
- Provides interactive network exploration capabilities
- Communicates selection and interaction events

### Build Process

crosslink-viewer is integrated into the main xiVIEW build process while maintaining its modular structure.

## Important Notes

- **No Vendor Changes**: Never modify code in vendor/ directories
- **Performance**: Consider performance with large cross-link datasets
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure SVG rendering works across target browsers

## Context Within xiVIEW

crosslink-viewer provides essential functionality for:
- Interactive exploration of protein interaction networks
- Visualization of cross-link connectivity patterns
- Analysis of protein complex topology
